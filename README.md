# jnrad - v 0.0.0

Rapid application development framework for Joomla! components.

## Abstract:

This is a work in progress, feel free to use it, collaborate, report issues or request new features. We don't have any release schedule or planification "yet", we will release/update as soon as we require/desire. 

Component development takes so much initial boilerplate and preparation that we decided to create our own framework for rapid component development in order to automatize repetitive and redundant tasks.

## Features

* $jrad is a confiruation variable on each component asset (models, views, controllers, etc) that offers hierarchical parametrized configuration.
* Back-end list view with support for: Toolbar, sidebar, text search, filtering, drag and drop row sorting, column rodering, check-in, classic Joomla! data grid with paginator.
* Back-end edit view that automatically renders the xml form file to a html form.
* Behavior and functionality easy to override on each asset.
* Basic routing support with minimal setup.
* Basic fron-end list, item edit view rendering.
* Back-end toolbar is now created with simple parameters.
* Back-end sidebar is now created with simple parameters.

## How to use it
